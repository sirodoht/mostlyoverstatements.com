I have been listening to the Florence + The Machine the last days, and they are beyond awesome.
Not only is Florence's voice sensational, their music sounds so original. I'm not sure why; but I feel
I haven't listened to anything similar. The harp, the drums of every kind, the harmonies...

Wikipedia claims it being indie rock/pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, art rock/pop, neo soul, folk.
It is art rock, but not like Pink Floyd or Muse, they have a classical aspect. The baroque tag
sounds fitting.
