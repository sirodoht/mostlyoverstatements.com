The Wall, by Pink Floyd. One of the most legendary albums of the rock genre,
if not across all music.

Biographical epic, inspired by the lives of Roger Waters and Syd Barrett.
Roger, the bassist of the band, and the primary writer of the album. Syd,
the original leader of the band, who at that point was not part of the group.

This album is a poetic manifestation of a life journey so brutally
honest that makes you wonder just how good music can be.

I have listened to it a few dozen times, from top to bottom,
and still can't help the involuntary teardrop at the final piece:

<em>
    All alone, or in twos<br>
    The ones who really love you<br>
    Walk up and down outside the wall<br>
    Some hand in hand<br>
    And some gathered together in bands<br>
    The bleeding hearts and the artists<br>
    Make their stand<br>
    And when they've given you their all<br>
    Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy<br>
    Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall<br>
</em>

And then the collapse of the wall happens in the background...

Every single one of those 10 lyrics is perfect; humane, theatrical, laconic yet complete.

The lyrics' value is connected to the question of who can relate to them.
Who builts walls? What are those <em>banging their hearts against it</em>?

The previous 25 tracks build up to the wall's collapse. All of them depict
some aspect of our protagonist's life; school, with the mythical
"Another Brick in the Wall"; maternal personality influence, with "Mother",
a candid image of an overprotective mother.

The answer to my previous question seems to be a great amount of people. And
especially in our era, the one at which the protection —or is it armoring?— of the
individual is everyone's responsibility.

I would love to make the understatement of labeling this album
as the greatest of the 20th century. But I can't. Because as I listen
to <em>Outside the wall</em> ending, I can only characterize it
as the greatest cultural piece I have ever experienced.
