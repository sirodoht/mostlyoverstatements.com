New song from Florence + the Machine. The song is nice, classic awesome Florence.

The video is interesting. Pitch black environment, along with colorfully clothed dancers make the
atmosphere trippy. The dancers' moves are mostly broken, agitated, and complex. At some
point, the dancers are suspended in mid air until Florence waves her hands. As mentioned,
<em>interesting</em>.
