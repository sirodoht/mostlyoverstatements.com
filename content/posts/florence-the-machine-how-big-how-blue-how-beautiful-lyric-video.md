How can you find words to describe this song? You can't; and maybe that's why it exists.
Florence has said that she describes both the ocean and the sky with this song. She also said
that the songâ€™s title was inspired by the sky in Los Angeles.

"How big, how blue, how beau-ti-ful!".

Apart from the utterly off world voice, the symphonic melodies of this song are outstanding.
LOVE IT!
