Pink Floyd's epic masterpiece in an out-of-this-world cover.

Theme from an Imaginary Western. Progressive symphonic perfection.
Such is the transcendence, that the band has expressed negative opinions in the recent years of this
piece of their work.

Inspired from a pregnant woman who had been fitted with a heart peacemaker,
<em>Atom Heart Mother</em> provokes the subject of sapiens-made devices enabling the -still
(?)- unexplained miracle of this world: life, soul, consciousness.

Lyrics:
<blockquote>
Fah<br>
See co ba<br>
Nee toe<br>
Ka ree lo, yea<br>
<br>
Sa sa sa sa sa, fss<br>
Drr bo ki<br>
Rapateeka, dodo tah<br>
Rapateeka, dodo cha<br>
<br>
Ko sa fa mee ya<br>
Na pa jee te fa<br>
Na pa ru be, mm<br>
Ba sa coo, ba sa coo<br>
<br>
Ba sa coo, ba sa coo<br>
Oo<br>
Ku-ku loo, ku-ku loo<br>
Yea yea yea um<br>
<br>
Hm ku-ku loo you<br>
Too boo coo doo<br>
Foo goo hoo joo<br>
Loo moo poo roo<br>
<br>
Here is a loud announcement<br>
<br>
Silence in the studio!<br>
</blockquote>

Apart from the two lyrics in english, all the other are spoken out of authentic exclamation for the
duality of our nature in the cosmos; thus the absense of any specific language, and the
presence of the universe-al one.

From animals and early humans stems the intrinsic notion of survival; eat and live. However,
starting with the societies of just 3 millennia ago, we concern our minds with questions such as
humanity's purpose, or the will of the gods. Our lives are drawn between the edges of "wake up, eat,
sleep" and "commit suicide because you have no purpose". These are the reflections of the
aforementioned duality, and <em>Atom Heart Mother</em>, an ode to this absurdity that perpetuates our lives
ad infinitum, achieves something nobody else has achieved: the musical manifestation of humanity's
desired cosmic balance. Fuckin' A.
