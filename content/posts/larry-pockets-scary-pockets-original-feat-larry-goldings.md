Only today did I discover Scary Pockets, and I love them already!

Firstly, Jack Stratton plays bass in some songs with Scary Pockets. Secondly,
Ryan Lerman (of Scary Pockets) wrote "Baby I don't know", the best song ever.
And finally, Jack Conte, the CEO of Patreon, plays keys for Scary Pockets! :D

This piece, Larry Pockets, is amazing. Funky, low volume, Vulflike and instrumental! <3
