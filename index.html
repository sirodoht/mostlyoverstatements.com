                    Unitopia is a  marvelous progressive rock band from Australia.
                    <em>The Garden</em> is an amazing concept album, pure progressive rock
                    with some sensational jazz elements, that give out such an enjoyable listen,
                    even for unaccustomed listeners of the genre.

                    The Wall, by Pink Floyd. One of the most legendary albums of the rock genre,
                    if not across all music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biographical epic, inspired by the lives of Roger Waters and Syd Barrett.
                    Roger, the bassist of the band, and the primary writer of the album. And Syd,
                    the original leader of the band, who at that point was not part of the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This album is a poetic manifestation of a life journey so brutally
                    honest that makes you wonder just how good music can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have listened to it a few dozen times, from top to bottom,
                    and still can't help the involuntary teardrop production at the final piece:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        All alone, or in twos<br>
                        The ones who really love you<br>
                        Walk up and down outside the wall<br>
                        Some hand in hand<br>
                        And some gathered together in bands<br>
                        The bleeding hearts and the artists<br>
                        Make their stand<br>
                        And when they've given you their all<br>
                        Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy<br>
                        Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall<br>
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then the collapse of the wall is heard in the background...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every single one of those 10 lyrics is perfect; humane, theatrical, laconic yet complete.
                    The lyrics' value is also connected to the question of who can really relate to them?
                    Who has felt that they have built a wall? And that there were
                    indeed "those who really loved them" banging their hearts against it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous 25 tracks build up to its collapse. All of them depict some aspect of our protagonist's life,
                    like school, with the mythical "Another Brick in the Wall", or with "Mother", a candid image
                    of an overprotective mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer to my previous question seems to be: a lot of people. And especially in our era,
                    the one at which the protection —or is it armoring?— of the individual is everyone's responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love to make the understatement of labeling this album
                    as the greatest of the 20th century. But I can't. Because as I listen
                    to "Outside the wall" ending, I can only characterize it
                    as the greatest cultural piece I have ever experienced.
                </p>

                    How can you find words to describe this song? You can't; and maybe that's why it exists.
                    Florence has said that she describes both the ocean and the sky with this song. She also said
                    that the song’s title was inspired by the sky in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "How big, how blue, how beau-ti-ful!".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the utterly off world voice, the symphonic melodies of this song are outstanding.
                    LOVE IT!

                    I have been listening to the Florence + The Machine the last days, and they are beyond awesome.
                    Not only is Florence's voice sensational, their music sounds so original. I'm not sure why; but I feel
                    I haven't listened to anything similar. The harp, the drums of every kind, the harmonies...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wikipedia claims it being indie rock/pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, art rock/pop, neo soul, folk.
                    It is art rock, but not like Pink Floyd or Muse, they have a classical aspect. The baroque tag
                    sounds fitting.
