                    Pink Floyd's epic masterpiece in an out-of-this-world cover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theme from an Imaginary Western. Progressive symphonic perfection.
                    Such is the transcendence, that the band has expressed negative opinions in the recent years of this
                    piece of their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired from a pregnant woman who had been fitted with a heart peacemaker,
                    <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> provokes the subject of sapiens-made devices enabling the -still
                    (?)- unexplained miracle of this world: life, soul, consciousness.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Apart from the two lyrics in english, all the other are spoken out of authentic exclamation for the
                    duality of our nature in the cosmos; thus the absense of any specific language, and the
                    presence of the universe-al one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From animals and early humans stems the intrinsic notion of survival; eat and live. However,
                    starting with the societies of just 3 millennia ago, we concern our minds with questions such as
                    humanity's purpose, or the will of the gods. Our lives are drawn between the edges of "wake up, eat,
                    sleep" and "commit suicide because you have no purpose". These are the reflections of the
                    aforementioned duality, and <em>Atom Heart Mother</em>, an ode to this absurdity that perpetuates our lives
                    ad infinitum, achieves something nobody else has achieved: the musical manifestation of humanity's
                    desired cosmic balance. Fuckin' A.

                <p>
                    Best song ever. One of the best video clips ever. Actually, all video clips
                    of Pomplamoose are amazing. Packed with visual comedy.

                <p>
                    The video is interesting. Pitch black environment, along with colorfully clothed dancers make the
                    atmosphere trippy. The dancers' moves are mostly broken, agitated, and complex. At some
                    point, the dancers are suspended in mid air until Florence waves her hands. As mentioned,
                    <em>interesting</em>.

                    The melodies of these songs, especially <em>Premonition</em> and <em>Visions</em>
                    are simply amazing. The heaviness and mastery of this album is of the highest quality.
                    Love it!

                    Unitopia is a  marvelous progressive rock band from Australia.
                    <em>The Garden</em> is an amazing concept album, pure progressive rock
                    with some sensational jazz elements, that give out such an enjoyable listen,
                    even for unaccustomed listeners of the genre.

                    The Wall, by Pink Floyd. One of the most legendary albums of the rock genre,
                    if not across all music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biographical epic, inspired by the lives of Roger Waters and Syd Barrett.
                    Roger, the bassist of the band, and the primary writer of the album. Syd,
                    the original leader of the band, who at that point was not part of the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This album is a poetic manifestation of a life journey so brutally
                    honest that makes you wonder just how good music can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have listened to it a few dozen times, from top to bottom,
                    and still can't help the involuntary teardrop at the final piece:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        All alone, or in twos<br>
                        The ones who really love you<br>
                        Walk up and down outside the wall<br>
                        Some hand in hand<br>
                        And some gathered together in bands<br>
                        The bleeding hearts and the artists<br>
                        Make their stand<br>
                        And when they've given you their all<br>
                        Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy<br>
                        Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall<br>
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then the collapse of the wall happens in the background...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every single one of those 10 lyrics is perfect; humane, theatrical, laconic yet complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lyrics' value is connected to the question of who can relate to them.
                    Who builts walls? What are those <em>banging their hearts against it</em>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous 25 tracks build up to the wall's collapse. All of them depict
                    some aspect of our protagonist's life; school, with the mythical
                    "Another Brick in the Wall"; maternal personality influence, with "Mother",
                    a candid image of an overprotective mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer to my previous question seems to be a great amount of people. And
                    especially in our era, the one at which the protection —or is it armoring?— of the
                    individual is everyone's responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love to make the understatement of labeling this album
                    as the greatest of the 20th century. But I can't. Because as I listen
                    to <em>Outside the wall</em> ending, I can only characterize it
                    as the greatest cultural piece I have ever experienced.

                    How can you find words to describe this song? You can't; and maybe that's why it exists.
                    Florence has said that she describes both the ocean and the sky with this song. She also said
                    that the song’s title was inspired by the sky in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "How big, how blue, how beau-ti-ful!".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the utterly off world voice, the symphonic melodies of this song are outstanding.
                    LOVE IT!

                    I have been listening to the Florence + The Machine the last days, and they are beyond awesome.
                    Not only is Florence's voice sensational, their music sounds so original. I'm not sure why; but I feel
                    I haven't listened to anything similar. The harp, the drums of every kind, the harmonies...
                </p>

                    Wikipedia claims it being indie rock/pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, art rock/pop, neo soul, folk.
                    It is art rock, but not like Pink Floyd or Muse, they have a classical aspect. The baroque tag
                    sounds fitting.
